In this tutorial we will discuss how to install Vagrant, create `Vagrantfile` and manage Vagrant boxes.

## Install VirtualBox and Vagrant

Because Vagrant uses VirtualBox to manage virtual machines, we need to install them locally.

### Install VirtualBox
Following command will download and installs VirtualBox.

After installation we will delete downloaded archive because we don't need it anymore.

```bash
wget https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/6.0.4/virtualbox-6.0_6.0.4-128413~Ubuntu~xenial_amd64.deb &&
sudo apt -y install ./virtualbox-6.0_6.0.4-128413~Ubuntu~xenial_amd64.deb &&
rm virtualbox-6.0_6.0.4-128413~Ubuntu~xenial_amd64.deb
```

### Install Vagrant
Following command will download and installs VirtualBox.

After installation we will delete downloaded archive because we don't need it anymore.

```bash
wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/2.2.3/vagrant_2.2.3_x86_64.deb &&
sudo apt -y install ./vagrant_2.2.3_x86_64.deb &&
rm vagrant_2.2.3_x86_64.deb
```

## Generate private and public ssh keys

We need to create generate private and public ssh keys to inject them into virtual machines managed by Vagrant.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "youremail@example.com"
```

## Create `Vagrantfile`

To tell Vagrant how to create virtual machine we need to create configuration file (Vagrantfile). 

```ruby
# -*- mode: ruby -*-
# vi: set ft=ruby :

# we use last version of Vagrant API
API_VERSION = "2"
# base image for virtual machine
BOX_NAME    = "centos/7"
# private IP address of the machine
BOX_IP      = "192.168.50.4"
DOMAIN      = "nip.io"
PRIVATE_KEY = "~/.ssh/id_rsa"
# will be injected to the host so we can access it
PUBLIC_KEY  = '~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub'

Vagrant.configure(API_VERSION) do |config|
  config.vm.box = BOX_NAME
  config.vm.network "private_network", ip: BOX_IP
  config.vm.host_name = BOX_IP + '.' + DOMAIN
  config.ssh.insert_key = false
  config.ssh.private_key_path = [PRIVATE_KEY, "~/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key"]
  config.vm.provision "file", source: PUBLIC_KEY, destination: "~/.ssh/authorized_keys"

  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |v|
    v.memory = "2024"
    v.cpus = "2"
  end

end
```

> We use `centos/7` image. You can find other images at [Vagrant Cloud](https://app.vagrantup.com/boxes/search).

## Launch Vagrant box

> **Vagrant Box** - synonym for **virtual machine** - prepackaged development environments that is the foundation of Vagrant.

Run virtual machine using created `Vagrantfile`.

```bash
vagrant up
``` 

## Enter to virtual machine

```bash
ssh vagrant@192.168.50.4.nip.io
```

## Snapshots

**Snapshot** - saved Virtual Machine state. Snapshots are useful when you want to restore VM state after particular
action (f.e. install software, configuration).

### Create snapshot

To create snapshot you can use `snapshot save` command:

```bash
vagrant snapshot save fresh
```

This command will create snapshot with name `fresh`.

### Snapshots list

To get snapshots list you can use `snapshot list` command.

```bash
vagrant snapshot list
```

### Restore snapshot

To restore VM state in some snapshot you can use `snapshot restore` command.

```bash
vagrant snapshot restore fresh
```

This command will restore `fresh` snapshot.

## Stop virtual machine

When you finish working with virtual machine you can `halt` it. This command gracefully shut down the guest operating
system and power down the guest machine.

```bash
vagrant halt
```

## Check virtual machine status

To check virtual machine status you can use `status` command.

```bash
vagrant status
```

## Destroy virtual machine

If you want completely delete virtual machine from your environment use `destroy` command.

It'll stop the guest machine, power it down, and remove all of the guest hard disks.

```bash
vagrant destroy
```
